<title>soviet grain seen enter spring on shaki note</title> <author> by maggi mcneil, reuters</author> <dateline> washington, march 3 - </dateline><body>soviet winter grain could be off to a faulti start thi spring after endur an usual dri fall and cold winter, weather and crop analyst said. prospect for anoth near-record grain harvest in the soviet union appear dim at thi point, but it is prematur to forecast ani major crop problems, analyst said. but the situat bear care watch over the next six week and will ultim impact the soviet grain suppli and futur buy plans, analyst of the soviet union said. "from a weather standpoint, you can say with certainti that the soviet are not get off to a good start and will have a lower crop (than last year)," gail martell, chief meteorologist for e.f. hutton said. the next six week in the ussr' grain grow area will be the crucial period that will determin the final outcom of the winter crops, martel and other analyst said. "where the crop is realli made or broken is still ahead of us," an agricultur depart author on the ussr said. the soviet union recent report that nine mln hectar of winter grain will have to be reseed due to winterkill. thi would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkil in ten years, the usda analyst said. with a time spring, soviet farmer would probabl be abl to rese the damag acreag with spring crops, but analyst note that spring crop normal yield lower than winter crop -- sometim as much as 30-35 pct lower. normal winterkil is caus by inadequ snowcov combin with cold temperatures. thi winter, however, snowcov in soviet grain area ha gener been excellent, so the bulk of winterkill, analyst speculate, like ha been due to a veri dri fall and subsequ poor crop germination. "fall dryness may be a problem. there' a good correl between mediocr crop and fall dryness," martel said. precipit last fall wa as littl as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern ukraine, and below normal over the entir winter crop area, she said. recent cold temperatur in grain area in which the snowcov ha been gradual melt could also have caus problem of ice-crust and winterkill, jim candor, senior forecast for accu weather, said. livestock feed need have probabl increas becaus of the fall and winter, analyst said. the dri fall damag pastures, the cold winter rais feed demand and a late spring would requir longer off-pastur feeding, they said. "the soviet are not in a desper situat ... they don't have to buy (grains) now," a usda offici said. but if the soviet are worri about their winter crop and if they feel that last year' huge crop of 210 mln tonn wa a one-tim fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more soviet buy might occur to insur crop supplies, he said. bad weather dure the next six week could push the soviet back into the market, weather analyst said. "a lot of winterkil could occur dure the next month and a half," martel said. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="yes" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="16620" newid="1300"> <date> 3-mar-1987 15:50:42.06</date> <topics><d>alum</d></topics> <places><d>canada</d><d>west-germany</d></places> <people></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;e f &#22;&#22;&#1;f0806&#31;reut r f bc-alcan-(al)-to-close-w 03-03 0100</unknown> <text>&#2;

"produc were offer us jam tomorrow but after their failur to discuss them last year promis were insuffici and we want a cast iron commit now," one consum said. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="yes" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="16633" newid="1313"> <date> 3-mar-1987 16:05:38.59</date> <topics><d>earn</d></topics> <places><d>usa</d></places> <people></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;f &#22;&#22;&#1;f0858&#31;reut u f bc-seaman-furniture-&lt;sea 03-03 0064</unknown> <text>&#2; <title>seaman furnitur &lt;seam> in stock split</title> <dateline> carl place, n.y., march 3 - </dateline><body>seaman furnitur co inc said it board declar a two-for-on split of the company' outstand stock. it said holder of it common will receiv one addit share for each share held as of march 20. it said certif repres addit share will be distribut as soon as possibl after april 10. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="yes" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="16634" newid="1314"> <date> 3-mar-1987 16:06:02.92</date> <topics><d>earn</d></topics> <places><d>canada</d></places> <people></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;e f &#22;&#22;&#1;f0859&#31;reut r f bc-&lt;scott's-hospit 03-03 0047</unknown> <text>&#2; <title>&lt;scott' hospit inc> 3rd qtr jan 31 net</title> <dateline> toronto, march 3 - </dateline><body>op shr eight ct vs eight ct oper net 5,219,000 vs 4,377,000 rev 214.9 mln vs 182.5 mln nine mth oper shr 51 ct vs 51 ct oper net 29.6 mln vs 27.9 mln rev 634.5 mln vs 569.3 mln 1986 net exclud extraordinari gain of 8,031,000 dlr or 15 ct shr. 1987 net reflect three-for-on stock split in 2nd qtr and issu of 1.5 mln subordin vote share in 1st qtr. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="yes" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="16635" newid="1315"> <date> 3-mar-1987 16:06:59.86</date> <topics><d>earn</d></topics> <places><d>usa</d></places> <people></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;f &#22;&#22;&#1;f0862&#31;reut d f bc-telxon-corp-&lt;tlxn>-s 03-03 0086</unknown> <text>&#2; <title>telxon corp &lt;tlxn> see higher revenues</title> <dateline> akron, ohio, march 3 - </dateline><body>telxon corp report it expect revenu for the quarter end march 31 to be between 26 to 28 mln dlrs. the compani said earn per share for the period should be between 23 ct to 26 cts.

"i'm veri posit on gm," said jack kirnan of kidder peabodi and co. "they'r clearli commit to enhanc sharehold value." however, some analyst worri about how gm will pay for the buyback and whether new model will enabl the carmak to recaptur lost market share. after the market had close yesterday, gm said it would buy back 20 pct of it common stock by the end of 1990. the announc sent investor today scrambl for gm shares, with more than 3.2 mln share chang hand by mid-day. the buyback plan caus sever analyst bullish on the stock to reiter buy recommend thi morning, and at least one increas hi earn estim for gm base on a good perform expect from new car models. but david heali of drexel burnham lambert inc said the repurchas program is not a positive. "the buyback doesn't realli chang the earn outlook and put more stress on the balanc sheet," he said, sinc gm will have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. the stock should settl back down to around 76, he added. heali project gm will earn five dlr a share in 1987 and 5.50 dlr in 1988, compar to 1986 earn of 8.21 dlrs. healy' number are near the low end of wall street estimates, which rang from five dlr to 7.80 dlr in 1987 and from four dlr to 10.80 dlr in 1988. like other analysts, heali see gm' share of the domest car and truck market fall in 1987. "on balance, gm car are not sell as well as their competitors," he said. in late february, gm car sale fell 8.6 pct from the year-ago period while competitor ford motor co &lt;f> and chrysler corp &lt;c> both post increases. but gm said februari sale show improv over january, ad that it expect improv in come months. overall, gm' share of u.s. car and truck sale should fall to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986, analyst said. the number includ imports. kidder peabody' kirnan said cost reduct and product improv thi year should lead to posit cash flow by the fourth quarter, which will help gm financ the buyback. "gm (stock) ha been a real laggard and now it' roll up it sleev and get serious. i think there' a major earn surpris in the winds," he said. kirnan rais hi earn estim slightli today, in part in reaction to the announc buyback, and see gm earn 5.65 dlr thi year and 9.75 dlr in 1988. "the compani is more concern than ever about improv their rel valuat with respect to ford and chrysler," he said. anoth posit for the stock is gm' dividend, current five dlr a share annually, which give it a higher yield than it competitors, kirnan said. and gm will rais the cash dividend 25 to 50 ct a share next year, he predicted. but analyst michael lucki of shearson lehman brother inc said u.s. car sale will weaken, and gm' new products, if successful, will onli slow but not halt the eros of it market share. "i believ their new car will be successful, but that will onli curtail loss in market share," which will fall to around 35 pct by 1990, lucki said. philip frick of goldman sach and co fall in the middl of the bull and bears. while he is recommend gm stock, he said result will not improv until 1988. "i'm not look for improv thi year. thi is a transit year for gm," he said. fricke, who estim 1987 earn at 7.80 dlr and 1988 at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cut and new car model will not affect 1987 results.

"no clear sign of such develop ha so far been evidenced," the central bank said. poor busi prospect are the reason whi econom growth will be slow, even though japan' term of trade have improv sharpli due to the strong yen. economist david pike of phillip and drew estim that in 1986 unit cost price fell 30 pct while output price fell onli eight pct, give a larg price margin advantag in the domest market -- as long as compani did not pass that advantag on to the consumer. last year' gap of almost 10 percentag point between the fall in the wholesal price index and the slight drop in consum price show that gain from the improv term of trade have been kept as profit by produc and distributors. the economists, however, believ thi layer of fat will protect compani for onli a short while. as more firm seek more profit at home instead of abroad, alreadi fierc domest competit will increase, fuel by lower-pr imports. retail price will fall. profit margin will suffer. a decemb survey by top busi organis keidanren confirm thi dim view is taken by the firm themselves. of compani poll in the key manufactur sector, almost 80 pct thought the high yen would creat a drop in product volum and 60 pct predict a drop in corpor performance, said keidanren economist kazuyuki kinbara. main counter-measur cite by the firm includ cut unprofit operations, reduc work to sub-contractor (which employ signific number of workers), hold down wages, and reduc bonuses. the govern ha said it fear unemploy could soon doubl from three pct now. unemploy and slow wage growth will obvious hurt sales. but reduc bonuses, and worri about individu financi secur could be even more damaging. twice a year, bonus provid wage earner with what amount to an enforc lump sum in savings, encourag them to buy larg consum product and spark a sale bonanza. to save funds, some big firm have begun a form of tie bonus, forc employe to spend it on the firm' own goods. economist also predict japanes will not save less than the averag 16 pct of salari they do now. on the contrary, a poor outlook and lower dispos incom could strengthen the resolv to put money asid for old age and illness, education, and hous -- the main drain on the work man' salary. the last govern survey of public opinion said over 80 pct of citizen will continu to economise. japan ha a rapidli age popul and minim social secur and it worker fear poverti in their old age. face with such a viciou circle, the government' reflationari strategi are sever limited. the commit by the rule liber democrat parti and financ ministri to cut the state debt ha result in small supplementari budget and attempt to provid fiscal incent without reduc revenue. independ economist have been less than excit at the results. provis for monetari stimulu is similarli limited. the 2.5 pct discount rate is so low it is polit imposs to cut it further, with the basic bank save rate at onli 0.25 pct, bank of tokyo economist haruo muto said. almost 60 pct of japanes still hold their save in some kind of deposit, offici figur show. move to directli inject liquid are unproduct while firm are plan cut in capit investment. the central bank is well awar that soar stock and land price are the onli current result of high liquidity. fear of inflat also limit polici options. polit analyst ascrib prime minist yasuhiro nakasone' 1986 big elect victori larg to a long period of almost zero price inflation. and he found thi year that attempt to impos a sale tax to offset tax cut arous fierc voter opposition. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="yes" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="18104" newid="1686"> <date> 4-mar-1987 14:04:12.35</date> <topics><d>crude</d></topics> <places><d>iran</d><d>algeria</d></places> <people><d>aqazadeh</d></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;i &#22;&#22;&#1;f0339&#31;reut u f am-oil-iran 03-04 0076</unknown> <text>&#2;

"the basic mean for europ is that japanes firm have a tremend interest in export to europe, where everi unit sold maximis profit in yen terms, which is what is import to them. suddenly, instead of the u.s., it is europ that is lay the golden egg," said de hora. the ec is worried. ec busi also had a remark year in japanes sales, but thi can be explain partli due to it start from a small base, compar with total japan-u.s. trade. the japanes think ec firm are now more competit than u.s. firms, a factor which is aggrav the exchang rate imbalance, and which will caus problems. "thi currenc align between japan and the ec is reflect the excel perform of the ec countries. but therefore, japanes good may keep their price competit edge," said azusa hayashi, director of the first intern econom affair divis of the foreign ministry. "if you want my object view, i don't expect a drastic improv in our trade imbalance. last year, we ask for moder in exports, and thi year we may have to do so again," he said. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="no" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="18345" newid="1927"> <date> 5-mar-1987 04:40:55.15</date> <topics></topics> <places><d>australia</d></places> <people><d>hawke</d></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;rm &#22;&#22;&#1;f0450&#31;reut b f bc-hawke-sees-four-billi 03-05 0106</unknown> <text>&#2; <title>hawk see four billion dlr budget deficit</title> <dateline> canberra, march 5 - </dateline><body>australian prime minist bob hawk and treasur paul keat said the government' 1986/87 budget deficit could hit four billion dlr against the offici forecast of 3.5 billion. hawk told a sydney radio station the deficit "may turn out at four billion." he and keat last week warn that the budget deficit wa run abov target and vow sharp decis on spend in a may 14 econom statement. a four billion dollar budget deficit would be in line with privat economists' forecast and compar with a 1985/86 shortfal of 5.73 billion dlrs. hawk said the 1986/87 deficit would be equal to 1.5 pct of forecast gross domest product against five pct when he took offic dure the 1982/83 year.

"sanction have provid a veri use excus for under- achieving. they did have a bad effect, yes, but they onli contribut to larg internal, econom problems," one said. the u.s. impos the measur and withdrew most favour nation (mfn) trade statu from poland in 1982 in retali for suppress of the solidar free trade union under martial law. the estim cost to the polish economi wa origin devis sever year ago by the institut of nation economy, an offshoot of the central plan commission. accord to one western envoy, an expert on polish econom affairs, it extrapol 1979 inform on growth trend in trade with the unit states, as well as increas in credit from western commerci and govern lenders. but the calcul were base on a time when trade wa boom and credit still flow freely, he said, dismiss the estim as "a theoret project base on a high point, which ha no real scientif evaluation." a foreign trade ministri offici said polish export to the u.s. in the late 1970 averag around 400 mln dlr annual and had fallen by half sinc the sanction were imposed. import have suffered, slump from around 800 mln dlr to 200 mln, as credit ran out. poland ha a dwindl trade surplu with the west. last year it wa one billion dlr against a target 1.6 billion, offici figur show. acknowledg that sanction have lost poland import u.s. market -- includ agricultur equipment, textiles, chemic and some foodstuff -- western economist say credit dri up for econom not polit reasons.

"mfn doesn't realli mean anything, onli that poland will not be treat wors than other countries. it will be difficult to regain access to the u.s. market becaus differ forc are in play now," said one western envoy. he said polish product were not competitive, and their qualiti wa too low. trade war and possibl protectionist measur amongst the u.s., japan and europ would also hamper poland' effort to regain entry. deputi foreign trade minist janusz kaczurba recognis thi fact recently. kaczurba told the offici pap news agenc recently, "make up our lost posit will take a long time and be uncommonli difficult, and in certain case impossible... in a period of two to three year it will be possibl to increas the level of export by onli about 100 mln dlrs." while poland is unlik to seek compensation, it say it ha a "moral right" to assist from the u.s. which it say impos the sanction illegally. but a western economist said "the argument that u.s. sanction were a unilater torpedo of the polish economi won't cut ani ice. the american will just repli that the pole act immor in crush solidarity." nevertheless, polish nation bank head wladyslaw baka, in talk in washington last week with the intern monetari fund (imf) and world bank, made it clear that poland wa look for a lead from the unit states. he wa quot by pap as say that poland would meet it financi oblig to the unit states, "but not in a short time and not without a cooper stand on the part of it foreign econom partners." he stress that the u.s. "had a particular opportun to play a part in the cooper polici of poland' partner interest in the settlement of polish debt." put it more sharply, one senior bank offici blame washington for obstruct talk with the world bank, imf and pari club of western creditor govern in recent year and said it should now play a more posit role. "a a major superpow the unit state can influenc intern organisations," he said, cite recent meet aim at stabilis currenc as an exampl of the extent to which western nation were prepar to cooperate. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="yes" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="18382" newid="1964"> <date> 5-mar-1987 06:47:04.89</date> <topics><d>trade</d><d>bop</d></topics> <places><d>uk</d></places> <people></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;rm &#22;&#22;&#1;f0645&#31;reut b f bc-u.k.-fourth-quarter-t 03-05 0074</unknown> <text>&#2;
