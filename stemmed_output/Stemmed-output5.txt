<title>u.s. offici disagre on reduc budget deficit</title> <dateline> new york, march 12 - </dateline><body>senior u.s. econom offici disagre on the likelihood the govern can meet it budget deficit reduct targets. beryl sprinkel, chairman of the council of econom advisers, reiter the reagan administration' opposit to a tax increas and it pledg to reduc the deficit by cut spend and foster econom growth. by contrast, rudolph penner, director of the congression budget office, said the budget process ha broken down and the deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlr for fiscal 1987. sprinkel told a symposium sponsor by new york univers that spend could be cut by avoid decis base on the desir to influenc vote and by shift the respons for local project to state governments. he also suggest a line-item veto, which allow the presid to veto part of bill without reject all of it, to limit wast spending. spend and tax decis should be link more closely. sprinkel said the administr still look for 2.7 pct growth in u.s. real gross nation product (gnp) in 1987 and 3.5 pct in 1988. ask if the latest econom report signal thi rate of econom growth is attainable, sprinkel said, "it look pretti good to me. we'v had two veri strong employ reports." he also said feder reserv polici is appropriate, adding, "it look like they'r on track." while further reduct are need in the trade deficit, sprinkel said the lower dollar is have an impact. the new 1987 tax law will not hurt the economi and the tax reform act of 1986 significantli lower tax rate and will greatli increas privat product incentives, he said. "our estim at the council of econom advis suggest nation net output of good and servic will perman increas by approxim two pct becaus of the long-run consequ of tax reform," sprinkel said. "in 1986, thi would have amount to an increas of approxim 600 dlr in the incom of the averag american family." sprinkel also argu the 1981 tax cut were not respons for the larg increas in the budget deficit. in fiscal 1986 end september, feder spend amount to 23.8 pct of gnp, while feder receipt absorb 18.5 pct of gnp, leav a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said. sprinkel said that, compar with fiscal 1978, the 1986 feder expenditur share of gnp is 2.7 percentag point higher and the revenu share of gnp is virtual the same. "contrari to the convent wisdom, therefore, the 1981 tax cut is not the root caus of the extraordinari budget deficit of the past few years," sprinkel said. "thi tax cut mere roll back the inflation-induc tax increas that occur between 1978 and 1981," he added. however, the congression budget office' rudolph penner argu that the tax cut in 1981 wa misguided. "sinc make the big mistak in 1981 of cut tax enorm without ani plan to decreas spend by the administr or congress, inde with increas in defenc spending, now all the option (for reduc the budget deficit) are unpleasant," he said. penner said the tax cut result from the ideolog turmoil in the u.s. caus by the "biggest sustain inflat in our nation' history," which help foster widespread distrust of government. "the american peopl turn on the govern with tax revolt at the state level and new demand on the govern at the nation level," penner said. "but their dislik of tax exceed their gener dislik of spend programs. now the correct of that 1981 mistak demand that the system chang a lot." penner see littl hope the gramm-rudman-hol budget deficit reduct target will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughli 200 billion dlr thi year. he said a budget process that set target arbitrarili is not like to succeed. "i feel pretti safe in say that ani process that tri to dictat a numer outcom from abov is doom to fail simpli becaus there' no ... way to enforc it," penner said. penner question the method by which the 1987 budget deficit wa cut. he said 18 to 19 billion dlr were elimin by one-tim measures, such as a temporari increas in tax relat to tax reform and sale of govern assets. "anoth four billion dlr wa cut by what i call creativ time changes, like move the militari payday from the last day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. that save more than two billion dlrs," penner said. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="no" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="9539" newid="4626"> <date>12-mar-1987 23:37:15.33</date> <topics></topics> <places><d>australia</d></places> <people></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;f &#22;&#22;&#1;f0981&#31;reut u f bc-adsteam-looking-to-br 03-12 0112</unknown> <text>&#2; <title>adsteam look to british market for investment</title> <dateline> adelaide, march 13 - </dateline><body>diversifi industri and invest group the adelaid steamship co ltd &lt;adsa.s> said it wa look to the british market for futur invest in view of high share price and interest rate in australia.

to six billion stg - is consid the minimum need for reassur financi markets, they add. the treasury' inflow of tax receipt ha far surpass that previous envisaged, economist say. lawson as recent as decemb 17 said that "i veri much doubt whether there will be much scope for reduct in taxat in next year' budget." the conserv govern is eager to get the basic rate of tax down to 25 pct as soon as possible, sinc everi pound off the tax base would make the opposit labour party' spend plan look more pain to the electorate, analyst say. the direct revenu effect of a one penni chang in the basic rate of incom tax would be about 1.1 billion stg in 1987/88 and 1.45 billion stg in 1988/89, treasuri figur show. lawson' budget speech to parliament on tuesday start at 1530 gmt, and is sure to echo the government' distinct tone of optimism, analyst say. the tax measur which lawson is expect to announc will be base firmli on a posit assess of past econom achiev and confid for the future, they add. but even if he doe cut hi plan psbr for 1987/88 by between one and 1.5 billion stg, as most economist predict, lawson is still like to find himself announc a higher psbr than the outturn for thi financi year.^m that could leav him with a present problem, economist say. a lower psbr would rais financi confid by reassur market that the borrow burden impos by the govern would stay low even if certain key aspect of the budget' arithmet seem over-optimistic, economist say lawson is slate to reaffirm the government' goals, as set out in it medium term financi strategi (mtfs), of reduc inflat and rais econom growth. regard monetari targets, some analyst expect him to drop the wayward broad money aggregate, sterl m-3, while retain the tamer m0 narrow measure. few forese ani other monetari aggreg be chosen by lawson for formal targeting. analyst were surpris thi week when the govern sanction a half percentag point cut in interest rates, in an attempt to cool down sterl and the gilt market. analyst had expect the author to wait until after the budget. further declin in bank base lend rate are anticip after the budget. mani analyst forese them fall by as much as a full percentag point from the current 10.5 pct level. the main elector attract of reduc interest rate is to cut mortgag borrow costs, and thu reduc inflation, analyst say. each one percentag point cut in the mortgag rate reduc retail price by 0.4 pct, govern figur show. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="yes" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="9587" newid="4675"> <date>13-mar-1987 05:15:51.05</date> <topics><d>money-fx</d><d>dlr</d><d>yen</d></topics> <places></places> <people></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;rm &#22;&#22;&#1;f0286&#31;reut f f bc-miyazawa-says-curr 03-13 0012</unknown> <text type="brief">&#2; ******<title>miyazawa say current dollar/yen rate not necessarili satisfactori </title>blah blah blah. &#3; </text> </reuters> <reuter topics="no" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="9588" newid="4676"> <date>13-mar-1987 05:16:38.71</date> <topics></topics> <places><d>japan</d><d>usa</d></places> <people></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;f &#22;&#22;&#1;f0287&#31;reut u f bc-japan-to-widen-part 03-13 0104</unknown> <text>&#2; <title>japan to widen particip in telecom services</title> <dateline> tokyo, march 13 -

"our estim at the council of econom advis suggest nation net output of good and servic will perman increas by approxim two pct becaus of the long-run consequ of tax reform," sprinkel said. "in 1986, thi would have amount to an increas of approxim 600 dlr in the incom of the averag american family." sprinkel also argu the 1981 tax cut were not respons for the larg increas in the budget deficit. in fiscal 1986 end september, feder spend amount to 23.8 pct of gnp, while feder receipt absorb 18.5 pct of gnp, leav a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said. sprinkel said that, compar with fiscal 1978, the 1986 feder expenditur share of gnp is 2.7 percentag point higher and the revenu share of gnp is virtual the same. "contrari to the convent wisdom, therefore, the 1981 tax cut is not the root caus of the extraordinari budget deficit of the past few years," sprinkel said. "thi tax cut mere roll back the inflation-induc tax increas that occur between 1978 and 1981," he added. however, the congression budget office' rudolph penner argu that the tax cut in 1981 wa misguided. "sinc make the big mistak in 1981 of cut tax enorm without ani plan to decreas spend by the administr or congress, inde with increas in defenc spending, now all the option (for reduc the budget deficit) are unpleasant," he said. penner said the tax cut result from the ideolog turmoil in the u.s. caus by the "biggest sustain inflat in our nation' history," which help foster widespread distrust of government. "the american peopl turn on the govern with tax revolt at the state level and new demand on the govern at the nation level," penner said. "but their dislik of tax exceed their gener dislik of spend programs. now the correct of that 1981 mistak demand that the system chang a lot." penner see littl hope the gramm-rudman-hol budget deficit reduct target will be met and said the deficit will remain at roughli 200 billion dlr thi year. he said a budget process that set target arbitrarili is not like to succeed. "i feel pretti safe in say that ani process that tri to dictat a numer outcom from abov is doom to fail simpli becaus there' no ... way to enforc it," penner said. penner question the method by which the 1987 budget deficit wa cut. he said 18 to 19 billion dlr were elimin by one-tim measures, such as a temporari increas in tax relat to tax reform and sale of govern assets. "anoth four billion dlr wa cut by what i call creativ time changes, like move the militari payday from the last day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. that save more than two billion dlrs," penner said. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="no" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="9641" newid="4728"> <date>13-mar-1987 08:13:40.78</date> <topics></topics> <places><d>usa</d></places> <people></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;f &#22;&#22;&#1;f0622&#31;reut r f bc-puget-sound-&lt;psnb>-s 03-13 0113</unknown> <text>&#2;

"the fed is go to look at thi positively," said allan lesli of discount corporation. "certainli inflat is not as bad as what volcker (fed chairman) ha said lately. industri product growth is along the line of what the fed wants." the energi product compon of ppi rose 4.0 pct in february, after a 9.8 pct increas in january. "thi show that the impact of energi price on inflat is behind us in term of the move from 15 dlr to 18 dlr per barrel," said maria ramirez of drexel burnham lambert inc. "the trend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year." in 1986, declin energi price contribut to a 2.5 pct declin in the ppi. economist said that a rise in energi price wa expected, but a sharp drop in auto price wa not. passeng car price fell 3.4 pct and light truck price drop 1.3 pct. yesterday, feder reserv chairman paul volcker said that a possibl of renew inflat remain a concern in both the financi market and the feder reserve. "the fed may be lower it own inflat expect today," said robert brusca of nikko secur international. while low inflat permit the fed to maintain an easier monetari policy, brusca said if import price do not rise thi could necessit a weaker dollar. "the outlook for the dollar is still up in the air," he said. "we need inflat for u.s. produc to compet with foreign producers." brusca said price of electron equip drop 0.8 pct in february' ppi. with mani electron good produc overseas, thi may show that foreign produc are not rais price which bode ill for u.s. competitiveness, he said. if further dollar declin are needed, thi could diminish oversea invest in u.s. debt, brusca added, which might necessit higher interest rate and lower bond prices. by contrast, slifer said import good price rose 11.8 pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflect to a larg degre a 22 pct drop in the trade-weight real valu of the dollar from februari 1985 to februari 1987. slifer said import price may rise further as manufacturers' contract put in place befor the dollar drop to current level expire, and new contract are made that reflect a weaker dollar. david wyss of data resourc inc note that import manufactur good price rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in the second half of 1986, which ha contribut to rise u.s. industri output.

"it' an encourag sign that the manufactur sector is begin to revive." but stephen roach of morgan stanley and co inc wa not convinc that the februari report portend econom gains. he said much of the strength came from factor that do not point to a sustain rise in industri output. roach point out that stiker return to work in farm equip industri help account for a one pct rise in februari busi equip production. util output rose 0.7 pct in februari after gain 1.2 pct in january, but roach said it show mostli that more energi wa produced, not that manufactur activ gained. finally, he point out that auto product account for half of the industri product gain as product of auto assembl rose to 8.3 million unit at an annual rate from 7.5 million units. "in the first quarter, it look like automak are produc at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate, but sell at roughli a seven mln unit rate," roach said. "the dispar between output and sale is show up in inventories." economist point to sharp rise in januari u.s. busi inventori as a sign that product may be outstrip demand in the first quarter of 1987. januari busi inventori rose 0.9 pct, the largest gain sinc juli 1979 when inventori rose 1.7 pct, the commerc depart said. busi sale drop 4.5 pct in january, the largest monthli sale drop on record. nonetheless, economist do not expect the fed to react to month-to-month changes.

"i view it as pre-negoti posturing," said analyst carol berger of cyru j. lawrenc inc, refer to both brazil and citicorp. brazil recent stop pay interest on it commerci bank debt. today, citicorp said it first quarter incom would be reduc by 50 mln dlr after tax if it list the loan as non-perform status. citicorp file an 8-k form with the secur and exchang commission, indic a materi chang in it financi situation. "citicorp is say you can't scare us with threats, we'll make your loan non-perform right now," berger said. the loan have to be treat as non-perform after 90 day without a payment. citicorp said onli that the situat will be review at the end of the current quarter. berger assert that brazil is do it own politick by talk to u.s. regul and tri to drive a wedg between u.s. and european banks. analyst lawrenc cohn of merril lynch and co said it is unlik the situat will be resolv until the second half of thi year. "ultim the brazilian are go to have to pay up on all the interest they owe," cohn said. "the real issu is the reschedul of debt terms. anoth question is whether or not the intern monetari fund can help brazil with a new auster program. stock of money center bank were mostli down fraction in late dealings. one trader most stock in the group bounc off their low by midday as investor took the news in stride. cohn said the bank stock may be riski until number on non-perform loan are report for each bank. but he said investor look ahead six to 12 month might want to buy at present level for the "tremend fundament values" in the group. analyst robert gordon of shearson lehman brother inc said manufactur hanov corp &lt;mhc) ha the greatest exposur to brazilian loan of ani new york bank, in term of percentag of earnings. he said hi onli two recommend current among new york bank are j.p. morgan and co &lt;jpm> and banker trust co &lt;bt> which happen to have the least exposure. gordon said hi posit opinion on j.p. morgan and banker trust wa not mere a respons to the fact that the two have lower exposur to brazilian loan than other banks. in fact he said there' a chanc those bank could get more involv in the future. he note that morgan ha alreadi set up a brokerag subsidiari to deal in loan to less develop countries. "i don't see ani reason to chang full year earn estimates, said frederick meinke, analyst at e.f. hutton co. he think the confront with brazil could end in a replay of a situat that occur with argentina in 1984 and 1985. meink note that in the case of argentina the loan becam non-accru for a coupl of quarter but then when the bank came to an agreement with argentina all the back interest wa paid. "what it did wa distort the quarterli earn pattern," he said. he said in the case of brazil write-off of loan is a worst-cas outcom which is highli unlikely. he note that brazil is a countri with a diversifi economy, go through some econom upheav after the transit from a militari to a civilian government. "the countri of latin america have too much debt rel to their abil to servic it," said john mason of interst securities. "we'v been fiddl around with these problem for five year and the hour is grow late." he said up to now the bank have reduc their spreads, cut interest rate intern and extend matur and none of these measur ha been enough. he expect re-classif of as much as a third of the loan as non-accru and he see partial write down of some loans. nevertheless mason think the money center bank stock could be pois for a short term rally. a spokesman at first chicago corp &lt;fnb> said it is prematur to put brazil' loan on a cash basis. "it is our expect that econom develop will allow brazil to meet it debt," a spokesman said. banker trust in new york said it would be prematur to make a decision. sever other bank queri by reuter said much the same thing. a spokesman at manufactur hanov note that of 2.3 billion dlr in loan exposur to brazil onli 1.3 billion is subject to brazil' unilater moratorium on repay of interest. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="yes" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="9881" newid="4970"> <date>13-mar-1987 14:24:53.75</date> <topics><d>acq</d></topics> <places><d>usa</d></places> <people></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;f &#22;&#22;&#1;f0092&#31;reut u f bc-chemlawn-&lt;chem>-seek 03-13 0067</unknown> <text>&#2; <title>chemlawn &lt;chem> seek bid by march 18</title> <dateline> columbus, ohio, march 13 - </dateline><body>chemlawn corp said it ha ask potenti purchas of the compani to submit their propos by 1700 est on march 18. chemlawn said if wast manag inc &lt;wmx> intend to particip in the bid process, it will have to submit a confidenti agreement to chemlawn financi advisor smith barney, harri upham and co inc. wast manag ha a 27 dlr per share tender offer for chemlawn underway that chemlawn ha alreadi reject as inadequate. chemlawn ha alreadi said it is hold talk with variou parti on the sale of the compani and said it ha inform all potenti purchas that they mnust sign confidenti agreemn to receiv confidenti inform on chemlawn. chemlawn said if wast manag were to sign such an agreement, chemlawn would suppli it with the same inform be suppli to other potenti purchasers. but it said it will not make an except for wast manag which would give that compani an advantag in the bid process. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="yes" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="9882" newid="4971"> <date>13-mar-1987 14:26:01.46</date> <topics></topics> <places><d>argentina</d></places> <people><d>machinea</d></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;c g l m t &#22;&#22;&#1;f0098&#31;reut r f bc-argentine-debt-talk 03-13 0131</unknown> <text>&#2; <title>argentin debt talk difficult-centr bank head</title> <dateline> bueno aires, march 13 - </dateline><body>centr bank presid jose lui machinea said negoti with creditor bank on argentina' 30 billion dlr privat sector foreign debt were difficult.
