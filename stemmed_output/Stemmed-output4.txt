"miti ha been move hot and heavi throughout the industri to get thing done," said bach secur (japan) associ vice presid peter wolffe. last month, miti told chipmak to cut product for the januari to march period by 10 pct to help dri up inexpens chip that have escap from japan to grey market not subject to the pact' price controls. the ministri also ask electron firm to provid distributor with certif design them as authoris exporters, in an effort to close loophol through which grey market sneak chip out of japan, market analyst said. u.s. trade negoti here last week said the pact wa in jeopardi becaus of continu dump in non-american market and littl sign of increas foreign sale in japan. but major japanes firm appear to have agre to the product cuts, sever analyst said. last week, nec corp said it would cut product in line with miti' request. "nec ha been the most aggress in resist miti' demands," said david keller, analyst at jame capel and co. "onc nec cut production, it mean they all have." still, pressur remain to keep product high. japanes firm need high output to cut unit price for u.s. sale that the commerc depart assign them under the pact. "the best way to lower cost is to produc more," said salomon brother asia ltd analyst carol ryavec. prepar for a possibl upturn in demand could also spur higher product next quarter, merril lynch analyst matt aizawa said. grey market may also be abl to outfox ani new restrictions, some industri offici said. "it' like tax avoid schemes," said steve donovan, head of mmi japan k.k. "a soon as you close one route, anoth opens." miti' pressur ha annoy some makers, who had earlier shrug off miti guidance. "it' get to be like communism," said one. but analyst said output cut could help by make it easier to increas price as plan on april 1 and forc firm to stop extend market share by sell at a loss. "they'r go to have to start run their busi like businesses," bache' wolff said. miti ha also been conduct a highli public campaign urg chip user to buy foreign-mad chips, but u.s. industri offici said respons ha been mix at best. "there ha been some change, but it' not across the board," said one u.s. spokesman. "the compani have a vari degre of urgency." the ultim impact of all these effort by miti on the troubl u.s. industri remain in doubt, analyst added. pressur to cut product of 256 kilobit dram (dynam random access memory) chip could mere speed the transit to one megabit chips, where japan now leads, analyst said. whether u.s. firm are abl to stage a comeback in memori chips, or interest in do so, also remain unclear, they said. analyst are watch with interest the fate of a new u.s. consortium which hope to challeng japan by develop the most advanc technolog for microchip manufacturing. even in the thorni area of access, much depend on u.s. commit as well as on japanes openness, some said. "the sia (u.s. semiconductor industri association) doesn't even have an offic here," a sourc close to the industri said. "you could question just how commit they are." in addition, some industri analyst question the effect of a bilater agreement that leav out third countri chipmak such as those in south korea.

"we call at the veri begin for the bank syndic to find procedur or process wherebi they could oper more effectively," the offici said. among those ideas, the offici said, were suggest that commerci bank creat a "megabank" which could swap third world debt paper for so-cal "exit bonds" for bank like region american or european institutions. such bond in theori would rid these bank of the need to lend money to their former debtor everi time a new money packag wa assembled, and ha been suggest by argentina in it current negoti for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs. he emphasis that the "megabank" wa not an administr plan but "someth some peopl have suggested." other u.s. offici said japanes commerci bank are examin the creation of a consortium bank to assum third world debt. thi plan, activ under consideration, would differ slightli from the one the offici described. but the offici express deep misgiv that such a plan would work in the unit states. "if the bank thought that that wa a suitabl way to go, fine. i don't think they ever will." he point out that bank would swap their third world loan for capit in the megabank and might then be reluct to provid new money to debtor through the new institution. meanwhile, the offici prais the philippin plan under which it would make interest payment on it debt in cash at no more than 5/8 pct abov libor.

"it' no more interest rate capitalis than if you have a write down in the spread over libor from what exist before," the offici said in comment suggest some ought to be grant the rate concess they seek.

"broker have to push their client somewhere...and technically, the pound is in the best shape," painewebb analyst jason gillard said. "we'v tri to take a bullish approach to the pound, and we'r go to stay with that, there' no reason to change," smith barney analyst craig sloan said. mani trader took on long pound/short west german mark futur positions, although some of those cross-trad were liquid yesterday, sloan said. the fundament key to the pound' rise have been rel high u.k. interest rate and a vagu optim surround the british economy, analyst said. "money seem to be chase yields," william byers, of bear stearns, said of the 10-1/2 pct u.k. base lend rate. mani analyst are skeptic about further gain in the pound, on the infer that the bank of england will seek to reliev upward pressur on the currenc by push down interest rate after the nation' budget is releas march 17. the budget itself could have an impact, depend on how well it is received, but analyst say rel interest rate and oil incom remain the main influenc on the currency. however, the market may be abl to absorb lower u.k. interest rates, as it ha done when other countri have cut their discount rates, and extend the pound' rally, sloan said. the canadian dollar ha not been rise like the pound, but sloan and other analyst cautious predict a big move soon. the sideway price pattern in the june contract, with smaller and smaller price ranges, ha form a "bull flag" on price charts, technically-ori analyst said. "it make for an explos type of situat that often lead to a breakout," in thi case to the upside, sloan said. byer agre there wa potenti for the june canadian dollar to ralli abov the 77.00 cent level from the most recent close at 74.80 cent to the u.s. dollar. "at thi stage of the game i'd call the market long-term positive, but for the technic burden of proof you need a close abov (the previou contract high of) 75.25," byer said. as to the tradit more activ currencies, stabil wa the catchword and reluct the watchword among analysts. sloan said it wa import that june swiss franc and june german mark held abov support at 0.6400 and 0.5400, respectively, close at 0.6438 and 0.5430. yesterday' rebound show the market wa still veri respect of the pari accord, and the threat of central bank intervent by the g-5 nation plu canada. "we may still probe to see what the paramet are," byer said, "but peopl are veri reluct becaus they don't know where the central bank will be (to intervene)." gillard said the mark could drop to a previou price consolid area around 0.5250 base on the profoundli sluggish west german economy, but that he would be a buyer at that level. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="yes" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="8449" newid="3536"> <date>11-mar-1987 08:12:41.58</date> <topics></topics> <places><d>uk</d></places> <people></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;rm &#22;&#22;&#1;f0748&#31;reut u f bc-storehouse-convertibl 03-11 0117</unknown> <text>&#2;
