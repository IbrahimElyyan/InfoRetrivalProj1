"thi is certif of incompetence," privat polit analyst stephen hess told reuter in comment on the tower report made public today. "it' as if he went befor a profession licens board and wa deni credentials." in one of the most direct criticisms, board chairman john tower, a longtim reagan support and former republican senat from texas, told a press conference, "the presid clearli did not understand the natur of thi operation." the report, which lent credenc to widespread opinion in washington that reagan is not in full command of the government, wa particularli damag becaus it wa prepar by a board of the republican president' own choosing. the three-memb panel made up of tower, former nation secur advis brent scowcroft and former secretari of state edmund muskie, doe not carri the partisan taint of critic from a congress control by the democrat party. "we'r fall by our own hand," said one republican polit strategist. "what can we say except 'we'r sorry, we won't do it again'?" the strategist, who work for one of hi party' top 1988 presidenti contend and ask not to be identified, said the report wa like "an anvil fall on us." hess, with the brook institut public polici studi group, said the report is the final blow to reagan' hope of regain the upper hand he onc had in deal with congress, the press and the washington bureaucracy. the report may also undermin the stand of defens secretari caspar weinberg and secretari of state georg shultz, who the report suggest were more interest in keep their own skirt clean than support the president. "they protect the record as to their own posit on thi issue. they were not energet in attempt to protect the presid from the consequences," it said. white hous chief of staff donald regan and former central intellig agenc director william casey also receiv strong criticism, but the blow were expect in their cases. regan, expect to resign or be fire shortly, wa savag for allegedli fail both to help reagan conduct the iran initi and to avoid "chaos" in the disclosur process. casey, who underw surgeri for remov of a cancer brain tumor in december, had alreadi resign for health reason last month. "thi is a stori about peopl who came up somewhat short of be heroes," tower told reporters. while reagan retain consider constitut powers, includ command of the arm forc and the right to veto legislation, analyst say it will be difficult for him to retak control of the country' polici agenda -- particularli with congress control by the democrats. the crucial remain question, they said, is whether the man in the street will forsak reagan over the affair. although hi job approv rate ha fallen as much as twenti percentag point in some opinion poll sinc the arm deal with iran becam public last november, hi person popular is still rel high. a lo angel time poll releas earlier thi week show that just 37 pct of those survey thought reagan wa in control of the government, but 55 pct still thought he wa do a good job as president. american enterpris institut analyst william schneider, a democrat, say reagan' loss of support among washington power broker could be offset by continu back of the public. "in the past, he ha been abl to go around the power elit by appeal directli to the public," schneider said. reagan will again plead hi case that way in a televis address next week. but one top republican strategist warn against expect a dramat turnaround. "the white hous ha to avoid build expect that cannot be met," said the strategist, who request anonymity. "they have to recogn there is no quick fix." analyst also point out that reagan' person popular ha not alway translat into public back for hi policies. they note he wa dramat rebuf in last november' elect when voter reject hi appeal and restor control of the senat to the democrats. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="yes" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="5572" newid="29"> <date>26-feb-1987 15:39:41.92</date> <topics><d>housing</d></topics> <places><d>usa</d></places> <people></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;f &#22;&#22;&#1;f0827&#31;reut r f bc-january-housing-sal 02-26 0103</unknown> <text>&#2; <title>januari hous sale drop, realti group says</title> <dateline> washington, feb 26 - </dateline><body>sal of previous own home drop 14.5 pct in januari to a season adjust annual rate of 3.47 mln units, the nation associ of realtor (nar) said. but the decemb rate of 4.06 mln unit had been the highest sinc the record 4.15 mln unit sale rate set in novemb 1978, the group said.

"it suggest order in the pipelin are depleting, which may quickli translat to a drop in production," midland montagu' maud said. wyss caution that too much should not be made of january' report, given that other report have reflect strength. but he acknowledg that the declin occur despit a 51 pct rise in defens orders, compar with a 57.7 pct declin in december. he also note that there wa a 6.9 pct drop in januari shipments, compar with a 5.4 pct rise in december.

"for the time being, the fed is follow a neutral path, with fed fund at about six to 6-1/8 pct," said darwin beck of first boston corp. "i expect it to continu in that vein." "excess reserv fell but they are still over a billion dlrs," ad first chicago' johnson. banks' excess reserv averag 1.03 billion dlr a day in the latest statement period, down from 1.50 billion in the previou one. after the fed declin to assign a 1987 target growth rang to the wayward m-1 money suppli measur last week, littl attent wa paid to a steeper-than-anticip 2.1 billion dlr jump in the week end februari 16. look ahead, economist said the fed will have to tread a fine line between the dollar' progress in the intern currenc market and the develop of the domest economy. "the market ha perhap exagger the dollar' effect on fed policy," said first chicago' johnson.

"the outlook is more worri than it wa a few week ago," said societ general economist alain marais. "we have the impress it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth thi year." "the big question is whether the government' polici of wage moder will be maintained," he added. the govern ha set public sector wage rise at aboout 1.7 per cent thi year, with a three per cent ceil for rise justifi by increas productivity. but the head of the socialist cfdt union federation, edmond maire, meet with chirac today, renew union demand alreadi reject by the govern for index claus to be built into futur pay contract to safeguard worker against higher prices. call the government' polici "unbalanc and unjust," he also demand invest incent to boost employment. he announc after hi meet that chirac had told him the govern would spend two billion franc on a seri of measur to boost employ and train andr bergeron, a wide respect leader of the moder forc ouvrier labour group, put similar demand to chirac earlier in the week while the communist-l cgt, the largest of france' unions, declar the defenc of it member earn it top priority. but with unemploy near 11 per cent last month, and still rising, govern support and some econom analyst said they were confid chirac could resist union pay demands.

<title>econom spotlight - auster measur in hungary</title> <author> by david lewis, reuters</author> <dateline> budapest, march 2 - </dateline><body>hungari is to embark on a new seri of auster measur to tackl a budget deficit which tripl last year after quadrupl in 1985. the target deficit in the 1987 budget approv by parliament last decemb wa 43.8 billion forints. but zoltan boesze, chief of the financ ministry' budget financ division, told reuter the govern now saw thi as too high and had decid "quit severe" measur were needed. "all the organ of econom manag have been charg with elabor further (savings) measures," he said. ask if these measur were be taken under pressur from the intern monetari fund (imf), boesz said: "the fund suggest it would be good to improv monetari results, and of cours the fund would support these efforts." imf team spent sever week in budapest late last year. boesz said preliminari figur show that hungary' state budget deficit rose to a preliminari 47 billion forint last year from 15.8 billion in 1985 and 3.7 billion in 1984. the economi overshot a target deficit of 23 billion forint becaus of poor perform by state firms, which need subsidi and tax incent to export and earn hard currency. the exact extent and natur of save are still under discuss but subsidi to state enterpris -- the largest budget item -- must definit fall, boesz said. subsidi to state firms, includ grant to maintain low consum prices, exceed the plan by nine billion to reach 164 billion forint in 1986, up from 152.9 billion in 1985. parliament approv 1987 subsidi of 170 billion forints. "i think that in 1987 it is quit imposs to keep up the former situat and we will be oblig to reduc subsidies," boesz said. "the central administr must be hard. ... if we are not hard then we will not be successful." boesz said the budget could also make save from reserv provis of two billion forint for central expenditur and 800 mln forint for transfer to local authorities. "i believ these reserv should not be use at all," he said. wage growth last year outstrip that of gross domest product, which expand one pct instead of a plan 2.5 pct. the author had alreadi signal a small fall in real wage for 1987, but boesz said firm will suffer sever tax penalti if they award nomin rise of over one or two pct. thi would mean a sever cut in live standards, as retail price inflat is forecast at seven pct after 5.3 pct in 1986. a four-month basic wage freez expir on april 1. about 40 pct of the 1986 subsidi to state enterpris and 33 pct in 1985 were made to maintain low consum prices. boesz said pure econom polici would dictat signific cut in price subsidies, but that social consider made thi difficult. but he added: "i think ultim we will be abl to make curtail in subsidi in thi area as well." he said hungari plan to introduc price reform at the begin of 1988 at the same time as person taxat and valu ad tax. the imf support these aims. hungari introduc a bankrupcti law last septemb in an attempt to shake out surplu labour from ineffici firms. between 100,000 and 150,000 worker are expect to be unemploy at least temporarili by 1990. labour disciplin is be tighten and firm may fire worker more easily. boesz said the per capita employ tax paid to the state by firm wa be rais thi year to encourag enterpris to shed labour. he gave no exact figures. istvan nagy, a senior financ ministri offici respons for draft the bankrupci law, told reuter last year he hope the law would cut state subsidi to enterpris by 50 pct. after subsidi to state enterprises, the largest singl budget item are social insur (153 billion forint approv for 1987) and transfer to local council (80 billion). interest payment on intern debt are set to rise to more than 10 billion forint in 1987 from between six and seven billion in 1986, boesz said. hungary' net hard currenc debt leapt by 54 pct last year to 7.7 billion dlrs, accord to provision figures, while trade with western countri plung into a deficit of more than 400 mln dlr from a 1.2 billion dlr surplu just two year earlier. boesz said last year' budget deficit wa financ 90 pct by credit from the nation bank, mostli from abroad, and 10 pct by the issu of domest state bonds. deputi prime minist frigy berecz told hungarian economist in a speech thi month that the country' economi wa in a "veri difficult" situation, but not in crisis. there would have to be a turnround with tangibl result thi year, however, and borrow must be use more effectively.

"i think all thi foreign interest in the so-cal italian miracl is realli exaggerated...foreign observ alway oscil in the case of itali between complet pessim and unwarr optimism," say luigi spaventa, one of italy' lead economist and a professor at rome university. accord to spaventa, these violent swing of mood have been occur for the last 15 years, with itali one minut seen as the "bad boy of europe" and unabl to rais a dollar and the next a worker of miracl and bask in admiration, "i think there' a lot of exaggeration...onc it use to be the underground economi and all the correspond of foreign newspap flock to itali to studi this. that wa anoth stori about noth - like write about a black cat in a dark room." spaventa, in tune with other economist and industrialist here, stress italy' recent achievements, particularli the dramat and solid recoveri in the fortun of industri enterprises, but warn that the economi is still vulnerable. profit of privat sector firm such as fiat s.p.a., &lt;fiat.m> and &lt;ing. c. olivetti and c. s.p.a.> are booming, the major state industri are back in the black after year of losses, inflat ha nosediv and the trade and balanc of payment deficit have been slashed. expect by some expert that itali is pois to replac britain as the world' fifth largest economi have also boost optimism. itali itself ha made it clear it is not happi with what it feel to be it second-r statu among the major industrialis countries. onli thi week, it angrili demand clarif of thi statu after be exclud from a meet of financ minist from the group of five (g-5) - compris the unit states, japan, west germany, franc and britain. itali said it exclus from the meet violat an agreement reach in tokyo last year to let itali and canada attend meet held by the five whenev discuss concern manag the intern monetari system. but itali need first to tackl some fundament problem still face it economy, economist and industrialist say. "we must not forget that our is still a vulner economy," warn fiat manag director cesar romiti. he say that while italy' recent achiev are inde caus for satisfact and optimism, the focu now should be on the problem still remain rather than those alreadi solved. the country' huge state sector deficit, high unemploy and a heavi depend on import oil are among the most worri problems, expert say. the size of the state spend deficit -- estim at 109,561 billion lire in 1986 and target at 100,000 billion lire thi year -- mean there is a risk inflat could spiral again, say carlo scognamiglio, head of the privat luiss univers in rome. inflat fell into singl digit for the first time in a decad in septemb 1984 and by januari thi year wa run at 4.5 pct, but it is still not low enough to guarante intern competiveness, economist and industrialist say. and unemploy wa run at 11.6 pct nation last octob accord to the latest offici data. recent offici data show that of a total 2.77 million peopl seek work in octob 1986, almost 73 pct were age between 14 and 29. unemploy in the south wa run at 17.7 pct, more than doubl that in the industri north. the organis for econom cooper and develop (oecd) recent forecast that italian gross domest product (gdp) would rise rise three pct in 1987 after expand 2.5 pct in 1986. but it warn that growth wa unlik to be enough to check rise unemployment. anoth problem is italy' relianc on import raw materials. the countri import around 80 pct of it fuel needs. thi factor actual work sharpli in italy' favour last year, when lower energi cost help slash the country' trade deficit to 3,717 billion lire by year end from 23,085 billion lire in 1985. but economist say the improv owe littl to ani structur chang in the italian economi and that ani revers of the trend in cost could have seriou consequences. if itali truli want to be count among the world' top industrialis nations, it also need to tighten up stockmarket oper procedur and encourag firm to suppli more qualiti inform about their activities, economist say. itali ha no control on insid trading. the countri also need to shed it rigid capit movement control -- a european commun direct call for these to be dismantl by 1992 -- but thi too will requir a less blinker attitud and a chang in tradit oper procedures, economist say. "even today, if i want to invest in the tokyo bourse, i doubt i'd find the expertis in a brokerag firm or in bank which would allow me to do that," say spaventa. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="yes" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="12524" newid="341"> <date> 2-mar-1987 07:23:29.84</date> <topics><d>money-fx</d><d>interest</d></topics> <places><d>uk</d></places> <people></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;rm &#22;&#22;&#1;f0097&#31;reut b f bc-u.k.-money-market-rec 03-02 0074</unknown> <text>&#2; <title>u.k. money market receiv 37 mln stg assistance</title> <dateline> london, march 2 - </dateline><body>th bank of england said it had provid the money market with 37 mln stg assist in the morn session. thi compar with the bank' downward revis estim of the shortfal in the system today of around 700 mln stg. the central bank purchas bank bill outright compris four mln stg in band one at 10-7/8 pct and 33 mln stg in band two at 10-13/16 pct. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="yes" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="12525" newid="342"> <date> 2-mar-1987 07:27:19.76</date> <topics><d>trade</d></topics> <places><d>japan</d><d>usa</d></places> <people></people> <orgs><d>gatt</d></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;v &#22;&#22;&#1;f0108&#31;reut u f bc-japan,-u.s.-set-to-b 03-02 0111</unknown> <text>&#2; <title>japan, u.s. set to begin high-level trade talks</title> <author> by rich miller, reuters</author> <dateline> tokyo, march 2 - </dateline><body>japan and the u.s. kick off top-level trade talk tomorrow amid sign offici from both side are grow increasingli irrit with each other. the talks, held annual at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of u.s./japan econom relations, will pave the way for american secretari of state georg schultz' one day stop-ov here at end-week on hi way home from china. face with grow congression protectionist pressure, the u.s. administr is press japan for speedi action to reduc it still huge trade surplus, u.s. offici said.

"i'm tri to put the problem on the table.... all of us would like to have a kind of equilibrium." he said. although brazil ha reject a substant role for the intern monetari fund (imf) in manag it economy, funaro paid a call in washington to imf manag director michel camdessu and to world bank presid barber conable. funaro note that inflat in februari had start to declin again and he expect brazil to achiev a minimum eight billion dlr trade surplu in 1987. bank sourc note that brazil' monthli surplu had declin to some 150 mln dlr in the final three month of last year, against a monthli one billion in the first nine months. brazil had the third largest trade surplu in the world, funaro said, although it share of intern trade wa onli one pct.

"at least thi year' poor rain haven't exacerb the situat too badly," he added. rainfal dure the current raini season ha been far below average, ravag all but the irrig land of larg commerci farmers. while thi may curb the amount of maiz deliv thi year to the gmb, the govern also act late last year to slash maiz product and forc diversification. call for a switch to other crop such as oilseeds, agricultur minist moven mahachi said an economically-vi price of 180 dlr a tonn would be paid thi year for onli half the amount of maiz bought by the gmb in 1986, and abov that grower would be paid an unprofit 100 dlrs. the poor rain have also advers affect other crops, such as sorghum, soybeans, groundnuts, tobacco and cotton, the agricultur ministri report at the end of february. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="no" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="12819" newid="635"> <date> 2-mar-1987 13:37:46.04</date> <topics></topics> <places></places> <people></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;f &#22;&#22;&#1;f0549&#31;reut d f bc-technolog 03-02 0084</unknown> <text>&#2; <title>technology/chip industri seek custom designs</title> <author> by catherin arnst, reuters</author> <dateline> new york, march 2 - </dateline><body>u.s. semiconductor manufacturers, struggl to stem a river of red ink, are increasingli look toward custom design rather than mass-market chip for futur profits. the market for custom chip - semiconductor design for a veri specif applic or product - is expect to expand by 25 to 30 pct thi year, compar with onli about six pct for the entir integr circuit industry. market research dataquest inc estim that sale of custom chip total about 4.5 billion dlr worldwid last year, about 12 pct of the total chip market. by 1990, however, custom chip are expect to repres a 12 billion to 15 billion dlr market, about 25 pct of total chip sales. more import for their vendors, becaus they are not a standard design custom chip repres a sellers' market, and price and profit margin can be set accordingly. high volum memori chip have becom "a perfect commod market," robert brodersen, a professor of electr engin at the univers of california at berkeley, told an industri forum. "the product is interchang between one manufactur and anoth and custom base their buy decis almost entir on price," brodersen said. he predict that, in the next few years, onli a hand of the world' largest chip manufactur (most of them japanese) will produc memori chips, the standard electron compon found in everyth from digit watch to computers. "the rest of the industri just won't be involved." last week' intern solid state circuit conference, the chip industry' annual forum for new developments, seem to support brodersen' prediction. of the 116 paper present at the conference, some 40 pct had japanes authors, the first time they have outnumberd the unit states. most of the japanes chip design were in the memori category, includ nippon telephon and telegraph co' attention-grab 16 mln bit dynam random access memori (dram) chip, 16 time more power than anyth now available. the most advanc memori chip describ by a u.s. compani wa intern busi machin corp' &lt;ibm> four mln bit chip, and ibm onli manufactur chip for it own intern use, not for the open market. the problem with memori chip is that they are all base on the same, well known design standards, so they are easi to copi and inexpens to manufacture. becaus such larg japanes conglomer as soni corp &lt;sne>, nec corp, &lt;nipny> matushita and mitsui have their own enorm consum and electron product lines, they also have a guarantee intern market for their chips, so they can produc huge amount at a veri low cost per unit. custom chips, however, are design for a specif customer, manufactur in small quantiti and expens rel to standard chips. comput market are increasingli look to custom chip becaus they are difficult to copy, thu make the final product harder to clone as well. intel corp &lt;intc>, the lead manufactur of the microprocessor that form the brain of most computers, alert the industri to it intent to switch to custom chip last fall. the company, which just report a loss for 1986, said it will spend 75 mln dlr over the next three year to turn itself into a lead manufactur of custom and semi-custom chips. intel join some 275 compani alreadi compet for a piec of the custom chip busi but it ha an advantag that the other do not. ibm, which own a 20 pct stake in intel, ha agre to share the design for mani of the 15,000 chip it make for it own use. intel will custom those design and sell them to others. it will also get to use ibm' proprietari comput system for design chips, consid by expert to be one of the most advanc in the world. intel' success is still not guaranteed, however. industri analyst note that it is far differ to design a mass market item than a custom chip that requir a close work relationship with the customer. intel spent five year and 100 mln dlr develop it newest 30386 microprocessor. a much faster turnarouond time, and much lower develop costs, will be requir for custom chip if the firm is to succeed. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="no" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="12818" newid="636"> <date> 2-mar-1987 13:39:00.20</date> <topics></topics> <places></places> <people></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;f &#22;&#22;&#1;f0555&#31;reut f f bc-******sears-to-restru 03-02 0006</unknown> <text type="brief">&#2;
