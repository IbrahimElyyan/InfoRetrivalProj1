"the basic mean for europ is that japanes firm have a tremend interest in export to europe, where everi unit sold maximis profit in yen terms, which is what is import to them. suddenly, instead of the u.s., it is europ that is lay the golden egg," said de hora. the ec is worried. ec busi also had a remark year in japanes sales, but thi can be explain partli due to it start from a small base, compar with total japan-u.s. trade. the japanes think ec firm are now more competit than u.s. firms, a factor which is aggrav the exchang rate imbalance, and which will caus problems. "thi currenc align between japan and the ec is reflect the excel perform of the ec countries. but therefore, japanes good may keep their price competit edge," said azusa hayashi, director of the first intern econom affair divis of the foreign ministry.

"thi give the farmer a guarante price, but still allow him to profit from higher market prices, if they are available, by forego hi option," kahl said. interest in promot understand of option trade among farmer also ha been stir in congress by a propos chang in agricultur polici that would have the effect of expos particip in feder farm program to fluctuat in incom subsidies. the propos -- support by the reagan administr and a cross-sect of lawmak -- would allow farmer to receiv at least 92 pct of their incom subsidi regardless of how much they planted. under current law, farmer enrol in feder price stabil program receiv incom subsidies, or defici payments, equal to the differ between a set target price and the higher of the support price or market price. the so-cal decoupl plan, or "0/92", would aim to curtail surplu product by elimin the requir that farmer plant in order to receiv defici payments. critic of "0/92" plan contend that if the scheme succeed in curb surplu output, market price would rise and defici payment fall -- leav farmer who chose not to plant with shrunken incom subsidi and no crop to sell. sen. rudi boschwitz (r-minn.), who ha been in the forefront of effort to decoupl incom support from acreag plantings, advoc replac the variabl defici payment with a fix and gradual declin payment. but mani farm state lawmak are turn off by the idea of offer fix subsidi to farmer who plant nothing. some congression staff member said they are intrigu by the notion of have the feder govern subsid the purchas of "call" option to help farmer hedg their incom risk. by buy a call option, the farmer would obtain the right to buy a commod at a particular price. if the market price rose abov that option price, the farmer could exercis the option and sell the commod on the spot market, make up most of the reduct in the defici payment. an aid to boschwitz said the senat might offer legisl link option and decoupling, but that it might have to await the result of a pilot project on futur and option trade mandat by the 1985 farm bill. the bill requir usda, in associ with the commod futur trade commission, to conduct a pilot program in at least 40 counti which produc major program crops. the program, onli recent launched, wa design to encourag produc to particip in futur and option market and to ensur that producers' net return would not fall below the counti loan level for the crop in question. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="yes" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="18933" newid="2515"> <date> 5-mar-1987 17:48:45.84</date> <topics><d>crude</d><d>nat-gas</d></topics> <places><d>south-africa</d></places> <people></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;i &#22;&#22;&#1;f0032&#31;reut u f bc-south-african-firm-to 03-05 0115</unknown> <text>&#2; <title>south african firm to continu tests</title> <dateline> johannesburg, march 5 - </dateline><body>south africa' state-own energi firm soekor said it would continu test after strike oil some 120 km (75 miles) south-southwest of mossel bay. dure product tests, about 5,000 barrel of oil and five mln cubic feet of ga per day were produced, it said.

"that sound like a reason strategy. but there is no way they can trade their way out of thi situation," aldo roldan, vice presid for intern servic at chase econometrics, said. roldan told reuter that brazil not onli had to tackl the problem of satisfi domest demand and compet on glut world markets, but also had to work to make it posit on foreign exchang market more profitable. "domest cost have increas (due to inflation) and export have not had the same offset movement in exchang rates," roldan said. the chase economist also said commod market were depress and gener did not appear veri promis for a countri like brazil, where pure commod account for some 50 pct of export and in 1986 had a total valu of around 23 billion dlrs. but he added: "they are alway pretti aggress and they have good foreign market channels." analyst said a key factor in brazilian trade will be coffee, and even without background pressur from foreign creditor the world' largest produc wa expect to hit the market thi year with a vengeance. negoti between intern coffe organ (ico) member to re-establish produc export quota broke up earlier thi week with major produc and consum accus each other of intransigence. "brazil would not toler a chang in ico regulations, which other want changed," one senior coffe dealer said. the dealer, who declin to be named, said brazil want to preserv it market share. at the end of the talks, he said brazil hint it could sell more than anyon els and other would suffer. brazil will be an aggress seller under ani scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusu heavi brazilian sales, the dealer said. "if they do come into the market at thi level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar, nineti or eighti cents," he said. new york coffe futur for may deliveri settl 2.29 cent lower thursday at 104.68 cent a lb, while more distant deliveri fell the six-cent maximum trade limit. presid of the brazilian coffe institute, jorio dauster told a press confer in rio de janeiro today that brazil ha no set target for it coffe export follow the breakdown of the ico talk on export quotas. mani economist and analyst believ soybean could be the focu of possibl stepped-up brazilian market efforts. "they will be more aggress thi year than they have ever been," accord to richard loewy, analyst for prudential-bach secur inc. loewi believ the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plu difficulti with storag would help motiv sell of the brazil soybean crop. "brazilian farmer also need cash flow and they can't afford to store the crops," he said. the chicago soybean complex ha been nervou for some time about larg south american crop develop under near ideal condit toward record yields. "we are go to see a veri rapid decline, earlier than usual, thi year in our (u.s.) exports," loewi said. tommi eshleman, economist for the american soybean associ (asa), said thi year' brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes, versu 13.7 mln last year. market will be veri aggress thi summer when price are usual high rel to the rest of the year due to the vulner of the u.s. crop to bad grow weather. anoth incent to sell might be trade anticip of a reduct in the u.s. govern soybean loan rate, offer to farmer who give crop as collateral, eshleman said. he said there ha been some uncertainti thi year about the soybean loan rate, which act as an effect floor for price by keep suppli away from the free market. farmer can forfeit their bean to the govern rather than repay the loan. "we'r get into a period when they (brazil) are start to harvest and start to export," eshleman said. but he ad it will be a while befor u.s. export fall to below 10 mln bushel a week from around 20 mln bushel currently. jose melicia from the research depart of drexel burnham lambert said brazil would be tri to export as much as it can thi year becaus of it econom situation. he said the debt situat wa a major consideration. "the brazilian govern also doe not have enough money to pay for storage," he added. ask if a return to an inflationari environ in brazil would make farmer inclin to hold onto crops, melicia said it would not make a big difference. on other commod markets, brazil' sell impact may be mute no matter it need to gener capital. brazil is face with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which could limit export to the world market, analyst said. the countri may have oversold and be unabl to honor export commitments, and thi plu higher domest demand caus by consum price subsidi on ethanol and refin sugar, will give it littl room to stretch exports, they said. brazil' other major crop, cocoa, is in it third year of surplus. "cocoa consumpt is basic flat and last year it fell, so i don't think they can start throw out cocoa and find mani more market for it," one analyst said. "if they come out as aggress sellers, the market would collaps and they can't afford to do that," she added. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="yes" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="18940" newid="2522"> <date> 5-mar-1987 18:03:43.27</date> <topics><d>crude</d></topics> <places><d>france</d><d>saudi-arabia</d><d>iran</d><d>iraq</d><d>uae</d><d>kuwait</d><d>qatar</d><d>nigeria</d><d>libya</d><d>algeria</d><d>gabon</d><d>venezuela</d><d>ecuador</d><d>indonesia</d><d>jordan</d></places> <people></people> <orgs><d>iea</d></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;rm &#22;&#22;&#1;f0057&#31;reut u f bc-iea-says-opec-februar 03-05 0108</unknown> <text>&#2;

"some of the econom indic are not as rosi as they were a month ago," he noted. he expect onli five to six pct m-1 growth in march and rise in m-2 and m-3 of about four pct. slifer see stronger growth of 10 pct in m-1 and five pct or less for m-2 and m-3, but the rate would still be moder enough to encourag the fed to eas polici if gross nation product for the first quarter prove to be weak.

"the time ha come to look at the alternatives," one season debt reschedul said. even befor brazil' move, the difficulti in syndic the 77 billion dlr financ packag for mexico agre to in principl last octob wa prompt top banker to examin the way they are manag the debt crisis. feder reserv chairman paul volcker, too, spoke recent of "debt fatigue" and the need to breath new life into debt reschedul procedures. there are alreadi sign of change. japanes bank are set up a jointli own firm to which they will transfer some ldc loan in a bid to strengthen their balanc sheets, improv financi manag and get tax breaks. but banker said a move toward a greater government role will be gradual. "the process is such that you cannot expect tangibl progress in a short period of time," one banker said. certainly, funaro got a frosti recept in washington and sever european capit in the past week when he call on govern offici to explain brazil' crusad for a polit dialogu on debt. assist u.s. treasuri secretari david mulford, for instance, critic what he call large-scal solut such as debt forgiv or the creation of new multilater lend agencies. "while such approach may have some polit appeal, they are impract and ultim counterproductive," mulford told a hous subcommitte thi week. he could have ad that ani propos that might be constru as a bail-out of u.s. bank would be a non-start in congress. but banker said the reagan administr could promot account and regulatori chang to foster debt-equ swap and debt securit and to enabl bank to consid interest capit as an altern to new loans. expert say the govern must also make it easier for bank gradual to write down their third-world loan books. mulford, in hi congression testsimony, urg the bank to explor differ options. "the bank should be encourag to look at the so-cal menu approach," he said. banker said the aim would be to keep the loan syndic intact or, conversely, to allow small bank to write off their exposur in a way that is not detriment to major lenders. big bank say it is unfair that small creditor continu to receiv interest on old debt even if they do not contribut to new loans. in effect, larg bank say they are make new loan that fund the interest payment on the old debt. to solv thi problem - and to streamlin the cumbersom negoti process - argentina ha reviv the idea of "exit bonds", which would be issu at a discount to small creditor in exchang for their exist debt, banker said. the bank would be rid of the loan but would have to recogn a loss. amid the swirl of new ideas, even the role of the commerci bank advisori committe ha come under scrutiny. the principl of consensu on which the panel oper wa challeng recent when citibank - ironically, the origin architect of the committe system - stubbornli refus for a time to endors financ offer to the philippin and chile. the strain have not gone unnot in washington. "there doe seem to be a lot of specul about the frailti of the bank advisori committees," a u.s. offici said. brazil' funaro heavili critic the panel in london on monday, charg that they are unrespons to new idea and that u.s. bank are over-repres on them. hann androsch, chairman of austria' creditanstalt-bankverein, said there wa some truth to the charge. "sentiment is grow in europ that we'r no longer prepar to bail out the u.s. banks," he told report in new york thi week. while u.s. banker obvious see thing differently, some have start to wonder whether the advisori committe is still the right tool for the job. "the debt crisi ha probabl evolv beyond the capac of commerci bank alone, at least in some cases," one top new york reschedul said. but, with govern unabl or unwil to play a larger role, banker see no altern to the advisori committee. "it' the worst form of govern there is apart from all the others," one banker said, paraphras former british prime minist winston churchill' opinion about democracy. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="no" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="19297" newid="2879"> <date> 6-mar-1987 16:33:01.61</date> <topics></topics> <places><d>usa</d><d>south-korea</d></places> <people></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;f &#22;&#22;&#1;f0575&#31;reut u f am-hawk 03-06 0089</unknown> <text>&#2; <title>u.s. to sell electron equip to s. korea</title> <dateline> washington, march 6 - </dateline><body>th unit state plan to sell 84 mln dlr in electron equip to south korea to upgrad that country' hawk anti-aircraft missiles, the reagan administr announced. the sale of 28 modif kit to upgrad the i-hawk (improv hawk) missil alreadi in south korea is expect to becom offici in 30 day without object from congress. prime contractor on the sale is the raytheon corp &lt;rtn>, which build the hawk medium-rang missiles. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="yes" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="19298" newid="2880"> <date> 6-mar-1987 16:33:49.99</date> <topics><d>gold</d><d>platinum</d><d>palladium</d><d>copper</d><d>nickel</d></topics> <places><d>canada</d></places> <people></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;m &#22;&#22;&#1;f0580&#31;reut r f bc-technigen-platinum-co 03-06 0086</unknown> <text>&#2; <title>technigen platinum corp in metal find</title> <dateline> vancouver, march 6 - </dateline><body>technigen platinum corp said initi result of a 13-hole drill program on it r.m. nicel platinum properti in rouyn-noranda, quebec, indic extens near-surfac zone highli enrich in gold, platinum and palladium. the metal were found in rock on the peripheri of a sulphid deposit. it said valu of up to 0.073 ounc of platinum, 0.206 ounc palladium, three pct copper and 4.5 pct nickel were found over a drill section of 13 feet. reuter &#3;</body></text> </reuters> <reuter topics="yes" lewissplit="train" cgisplit="training-set" oldid="19299" newid="2881"> <date> 6-mar-1987 16:36:36.72</date> <topics><d>livestock</d></topics> <places><d>usa</d></places> <people></people> <orgs></orgs> <exchanges></exchanges> <companies></companies> <unknown> &#5;&#5;&#5;c l &#22;&#22;&#1;f0585&#31;reut r f bc-american-pork-congr 03-06 0134</unknown> <text>&#2; <title>american pork congress to be overhaul in 1988</title> <dateline> chicago, march 6 - </dateline><body>th nation pork produc council, nppc, announc at thi year' american pork congress, apc, that the congress and trade show will be divid into two part in 1988. next year apc, held in atlanta, will be a busi session onli and will continu to be the first week of march. the trade show is be chang into a new intern event call the world pork expo. the first expo will be held in june 1988 in de moin with an expand format, they said. execut vice-presid orvil sweet said the decis to spilt the show and congress came about becaus there are produc who never get to see the trade show floor.
