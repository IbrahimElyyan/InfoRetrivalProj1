Profits domestic consumption meant replace exports engine growth. close ties corporate performance wages mean alternative economic model promises little slower growth, said. Falling profits may lead falling incomes, turn cut sales reduce profits. Bank Japan said latest outlook improved terms trade linked strong yen would help domestic demand grow steadily. However, would happen household spending increased line value real financial assets due stable prices, and/or corporate investment recovered profits domestic sales improved compared exports. "No clear sign developments far evidenced," central bank said. Poor business prospects reason economic growth slow, even though Japan's terms trade improved sharply due strong yen. Economist David Pike Phillips Drew estimates 1986 unit cost prices fell 30 pct output prices fell eight pct, giving large price margin advantage domestic market -- long companies pass advantage consumer. Last year's gap almost 10 percentage points fall wholesale price index slight drop consumer prices shows gains improved terms trade kept profits producers distributors. economists, however, believe layer fat protect companies short while. firms seek profits home instead abroad, already fierce domestic competition increase, fueled lower-priced imports. Retail prices fall. Profit margins suffer. December survey top business organisation Keidanren confirms dim view taken firms themselves. companies polled key manufacturing sector, almost 80 pct thought high yen would create drop production volume 60 pct predicted drop corporate performance, said Keidanren economist Kazuyuki Kinbara. Main counter-measures cited firms include cutting unprofitable operations, reducing work sub-contractors (which employ significant numbers workers), holding wages, reducing bonuses. government said fears unemployment could soon double three pct now. Unemployment slow wage growth obviously hurt sales. reduced bonuses, worries individual financial security could even damaging. Twice year, bonuses provide wage earners amounts enforced lump sum savings, encouraging buy large consumer products sparking sales bonanza. save funds, big firms begun form tied bonus, forcing employees spend firm's goods. Economists also predict Japanese save less average 16 pct salary now. contrary, poor outlook lower disposable income could strengthen resolve put money aside old age illness, education, housing -- main drains working man's salary. last government survey public opinion said 80 pct citizens continue economise. Japan rapidly ageing population minimal social security workers fear poverty old age. Faced vicious circle, government's reflationary strategies severely limited. commitment ruling Liberal Democratic Party Finance Ministry cut state debt resulted small supplementary budgets attempts provide fiscal incentive without reducing revenue. Independent economists less excited results. Provision monetary stimulus similarly limited. 2.5 pct discount rate low politically impossible cut further, basic bank savings rate 0.25 pct, Bank Tokyo economist Haruo Muto said. Almost 60 pct Japanese still hold savings kind deposit, official figures show. Moves directly inject liquidity unproductive firms planning cuts capital investment. central bank well aware soaring stock land prices current results high liquidity. Fear inflation also limits policy options. Political analysts ascribe Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's 1986 big election victory largely long period almost zero price inflation. found year attempts impose sales tax offset tax cuts arouses fierce voter opposition.
