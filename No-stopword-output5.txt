Beryl Sprinkel, chairman Council Economic Advisers, reiterated Reagan Administration's opposition tax increase pledge reduce deficit cutting spending fostering economic growth. contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director Congressional Budget Office, said budget process broken deficit remain close 200 billion dlrs fiscal 1987. Sprinkel told symposium sponsored New York University spending could cut avoiding decisions based desire influence votes shifting responsibility local projects state governments. also suggested line-item veto, allows President veto parts bill without rejecting it, limit wasteful spending. Spending taxing decisions linked closely. Sprinkel said Administration still looks 2.7 pct growth U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) 1987 3.5 pct 1988. Asked latest economic reports signal rate economic growth attainable, Sprinkel said, "It looks pretty good me. We've two strong employment reports." also said federal reserve policy appropriate, adding, "It looks like they're track." reductions needed trade deficit, Sprinkel said lower dollar impact. new 1987 tax laws hurt economy tax reform act 1986 significantly lowers tax rates greatly increase private production incentives, said. "Our estimates Council Economic Advisers suggest national net output goods services permanently increase approximately two pct long-run consequences tax reform," Sprinkel said. "In 1986, would amounted increase approximately 600 dlrs income average American family." Sprinkel also argued 1981 tax cuts responsible large increase budget deficit. fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted 23.8 pct GNP, federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct GNP, leaving deficit 5.3 pct, said. Sprinkel said that, compared fiscal 1978, 1986 federal expenditure share GNP 2.7 percentage points higher revenue share GNP virtually same. "Contrary conventional wisdom, therefore, 1981 tax cut root cause extraordinary budget deficits past years," Sprinkel said. "This tax cut merely rolled back inflation-induced tax increases occurred 1978 1981," added. However, Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner argued tax cut 1981 misguided. "Since making big mistake 1981 cutting taxes enormously without plan decrease spending Administration Congress, indeed increases defence spending, options (for reducing budget deficit) unpleasant," said. Penner said tax cut resulted ideological turmoil U.S. Caused "biggest sustained inflation nation's history," helped foster widespread distrust government. "The American people turned government tax revolt state level new demands government national level," Penner said. "But dislike taxes exceeded general dislike spending programs. correction 1981 mistake demands system change lot." Penner sees little hope Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit reduction targets met said deficit remain roughly 200 billion dlrs year. said budget process sets targets arbitrarily likely succeed. "I feel pretty safe saying process tries dictate numerical outcome doomed fail simply there's ... Way enforce it," Penner said. Penner questioned methods 1987 budget deficit cut. said 18 19 billion dlrs eliminated one-time measures, temporary increase taxes related tax reform sales government assets. "Another four billion dlrs cut call creative timing changes, like moving military payday last day fiscal 1987 first day fiscal 1988. saved two billion dlrs," Penner said.

Beryl Sprinkel, chairman Council Economic Advisers, reiterated Reagan Administration's opposition tax increase pledge reduce deficit cutting spending fostering economic growth. contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director Congressional Budget Office, said budget process broken deficit remain close 200 billion dlrs fiscal 1987. Sprinkel told symposium sponsored New York University spending could cut avoiding decisions based desire influence votes shifting responsibility local projects state governments. also suggested line-item veto, allows President veto parts bill without rejecting it, limit wasteful spending. Spending taxing decisions linked closely. Sprinkel said Administration still looks 2.7 pct growth U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) 1987 3.5 pct 1988. Asked latest economic reports signal rate economic growth attainable, Sprinkel said, "It looks pretty good me. We've two strong employment reports." also said federal reserve policy appropriate, adding, "It looks like they're track." reductions needed trade deficit, Sprinkel said lower dollar impact. new 1987 tax laws hurt economy tax reform act 1986 significantly lowers tax rates greatly increase private production incentives, said. "Our estimates Council Economic Advisers suggest national net output goods services permanently increase approximately two pct long-run consequences tax reform," Sprinkel said. "In 1986, would amounted increase approximately 600 dlrs income average American family." Sprinkel also argued 1981 tax cuts responsible large increase budget deficit. fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted 23.8 pct GNP, federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct GNP, leaving deficit 5.3 pct, said. Sprinkel said that, compared fiscal 1978, 1986 federal expenditure share GNP 2.7 percentage points higher revenue share GNP virtually same. "Contrary conventional wisdom, therefore, 1981 tax cut root cause extraordinary budget deficits past years," Sprinkel said. "This tax cut merely rolled back inflation-induced tax increases occurred 1978 1981," added. However, Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner argued tax cut 1981 misguided. "Since making big mistake 1981 cutting taxes enormously without plan decrease spending Administration Congress, indeed increases defence spending, options (for reducing budget deficit) unpleasant," said. Penner said tax cut resulted ideological turmoil U.S. Caused "biggest sustained inflation nation's history," helped foster widespread distrust government. "The American people turned government tax revolt state level new demands government national level," Penner said. "But dislike taxes exceeded general dislike spending programs. correction 1981 mistake demands system change lot." Penner sees little hope Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget deficit reduction targets met said deficit remain roughly 200 billion dlrs year. said budget process sets targets arbitrarily likely succeed. "I feel pretty safe saying process tries dictate numerical outcome doomed fail simply there's ... Way enforce it," Penner said. Penner questioned methods 1987 budget deficit cut. said 18 19 billion dlrs eliminated one-time measures, temporary increase taxes related tax reform sales government assets. "Another four billion dlrs cut call creative timing changes, like moving military payday last day fiscal 1987 first day fiscal 1988. saved two billion dlrs," Penner said.
